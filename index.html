<h1>Project 77-Project on Console</h1>
<p>Visual Studio Code is a streamlined code editor with support for development operations like debugging, task running, and version control. It aims to provide just the tools a developer needs for a quick code-build-debug cycle and leaves more complex workflows to fuller featured IDEs, such as Visual Studio IDE.</p>
<p>It usually means a combination of a display monitor and an input device, usually a keyboard and mouse pair, which allows a user to input commands and receive visual output from a computer or computer system. The console screen is a specialized desktop computer used to play video games. The two most popular consoles are Sony's PlayStation and Microsoft's Xbox. Nintendo's Wii is also a contender that simulates physical participation in activities such as bowling and playing tennis. Video game consoles rely on CPUs (central processing unit) to calculate various aspects of the game and control how the game responds to user input. It is essentially processing the game's instructions and handles game logic in the form of movement or interaction with objects.</p>
